# Berisso Tourism Showcase
## What is it? 
It's a simple website simulating a business card, only for practice.
It's also the first project, part of the Scrimba Course, that I uploaded to Github. This project is part of module 2, where they teach you the web dev basics.
## What did I use? 
I used HTML and CSS
## What did I learn?
 ### Things explained but that I already knew
  * `class` attribute to use with CSS
  * use `display:flexbox` in a container to change children's display
  * **Inheritance**, change parent style can change style in some children
  * **Shorthands** for CSS properties, like margin and padding
  * **Web-safe-fonts** to put in font-family, for when other fonts don't load correctly 
  * **Color palettes** for design, to use colors that combine correctly, and not overuse them
 ### Things explained that were useful to me
  * `alt` attribute to describe img tags, to help explain the image when it's not loading, or when a visually impaired person wants to know what it is showing in the image
## Why is the website too simple if I know how to make it better?
I want to only use the things that I learned in the Scrimba course, before doing the project and after I complete the course, return to the projects individually and improve them with all the things necessary for a correct website. I don't want to modify the website too much; and make it difficult to improve or fix after.
